      <h1>About the Project:</h1>
      <h4>
        <br />
        The project bridges gap that is mandatory physical presence for document verification through the use of Blockchain and Web3 Storage which provides secure data transfer.
        <b>BLOCKCHAIN:</b>
        <br />
        Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can
        be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.
        <strong> <br></be><i>Advantages:</i> </strong><br>
        <br />
        <b>Immutable records</b>
        <br />
        No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it's been recorded to the shared ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse the error, and both transactions are then visible.
        <br />

        <b>Smart contracts </b>
        <br />
        To speed transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract — is stored on the blockchain and executed automatically. A smart contract can define conditions for corporate bond transfers, include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.
        <br />

        <b>Greater trust </b>
        <br />
        With blockchain, as a member of a members-only network, you can rest assured that you are receiving accurate and timely data, and that your confidential blockchain records will be shared only with network members to whom you have specifically granted access.
        <br />
        <b>Greater security</b>
        <br />
        Consensus on data accuracy is required from all network members, and all validated transactions are immutable because they are recorded permanently. No one, not even a system administrator, can delete a transaction.
